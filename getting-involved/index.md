There are a few different ways that you can get involved in Project Baird,
whatever you can contribute to the project.

The [wiki pages](http://wiki.github.com/nexgenta/Baird/) are all editable by anybody —
all you need is a (free) GitHub account. Feel free to add comments or make
additions and amendments to what’s there.

Once the specifications themselves begin to be drafted, they will be placed in
[the repository itself](http://github.com/nexgenta/Baird/) (which this website points to). Anybody can use <code>git</code>
to clone the repository — collaborators can commit directly to it, but anybody
else can fork the project and send a “Pull request” to alert us to the fact
that you have made changes which you think should be integrated into the
main repository.

You can also file [issues](http://github.com/nexgenta/Baird/issues) against
the project, either with feature requests (for example, support for particular
kinds of device, new services, and so on), or to highlight problems with
the specifications.

If all else fails, you can send an e-mail to [baird@projectbaird.com](mailto:baird@projectbaird.com).

We don’t have a mailing list for discussions yet, but if you have a Mailman installation you
don’t mind donating, please get in touch!
