There are a few different ways that you can get involved in Project Baird,
whatever you can contribute to the project.

The [wiki pages](http://github.com/nexgenta/Baird/wiki/) are all editable by
anybody — all you need is a (free) GitHub account. Feel free to add comments or
make additions and amendments to what’s there.

Once the specifications themselves begin to be drafted, they will be placed in
[the repository itself](http://github.com/nexgenta/Baird/) (which this website points to). Anybody can use <code>git</code>
to clone the repository — collaborators can commit directly to it, but anybody
else can fork the project and send a “Pull request” to alert us to the fact
that you have made changes which you think should be integrated into the
main repository.

You can also file [issues](http://github.com/nexgenta/Baird/issues) against
the project, either with feature requests (for example, support for particular
kinds of device, new services, and so on), or to highlight problems with
the specifications.

A mailing list for discussing Project Baird is being generously hosted by
[Martyn Drake](http://www.drake.org.uk/). You can subscribe and browse the
archives at the [list information page](http://lists.drake.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/baird-discuss_lists.drake.org.uk).

If all else fails, you can send an e-mail to [baird@projectbaird.com](mailto:baird@projectbaird.com).
