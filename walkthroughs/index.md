This section contains process walkthroughs: step-by-step recipes for how to
accomplish different kinds of things with the various parts of Project Baird.

To aid in readability, none of these walkthroughs describe the caching procedures
which would ordinary take place — they assume a clean slate.

* [Locating programme information for over-the-air broadcasts](broadcast-metadata/)
* [Retrieving broadcast-related metadata on companion devices](companion-metadata/)
* [Determining whether a programme is or will be available for on-demand viewing](alternate-on-demand/)
* [Collating a list of all services provided by an over-the-air broadcaster](service-manifests/)
* Locating a stream on a companion device for a programme being delivered over-the-air
* Locating MHEG and HTML applications related to programmes
* Locating alternate views/streams related to programmes

This list is a work-in-progress; it will be expanded over time as specifications are finalised.
