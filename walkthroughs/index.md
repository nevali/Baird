This section contains process walkthroughs: step-by-step recipes for how to
accomplish different kinds of things with the various parts of Project Baird.

To aid in readability, none of these walkthroughs describe the caching procedures
which would ordinary take place — they assume a clean slate.

* [Locating programme information for over-the-air broadcasts](broadcast-metadata/)
* [Retrieving broadcast-related metadata on companion devices](companion-metadata/)
* [Determining whether a programme is or will be available for on-demand viewing](alternate-on-demand/)
* [Collating a list of all services provided by an over-the-air broadcaster](service-manifests/)
* Locating a stream on a companion device for a programme being delivered over-the-air
* [Locating MHEG and HTML applications related to programmes](locating-interactive-apps/)
* Locating alternate views/streams related to programmes

This list is a work-in-progress; it will be expanded over time as specifications are finalised.

### Models

The various components of Project Baird support a range of different model. The
specifications do not in general make assumptions about the precise model in
use, although the general assumption is that the most limiting factor is that
of hardware and software capabilities.

Some models in which these specifications might be used include:

* Broadcaster delivers extended metadata and catch-up services to connected receivers
* ISP offers linear and/or on-demand programming in addition to that delivered over-the-air
* Companion devices, such as tablets and mobile phones, communicate with one another and with a connected receiver in order to present secondary content, applications and recommendations
* Linear and/or on-demand content is delivered to receiving devices or software on a PC or mobile device with no over-the-air reception capabilities
