## Project Baird: Aims

Project Baird seeks to collate and build upon existing Internet and broadcasting
standards in order to provide ways for Internet-connected digital television
receivers (e.g., TVs, set-top boxes, PVRs, DVB-H mobile handsets, and PC tuner
hardware and software) to link linearly-broadcast programming and IP-delivered
content and services together.
