Internet-Draft         Now Playing (NOWP) protocol             July 2010


1.  Introduction

   As media receivers (and other devices) such as televisions and radios
   gain the ability to communicate on local networks, a class of
   applications has arisen which depends, at least in part, on being
   able to query a media device for information about the programme or
   service it is currently playing.

   This document sets out a simple protocol which allows:

   o  media devices to be easily queried for "Now playing" information;
      and

   o  media devices to advertise the availability of this service to
      other devices on a local network.

   Rather than be reliant upon the many different ways in which a piece
   of content might be described, the NOWP protocol instead relies on
   content and services having one or more identifiers -- in the form of
   URIs -- which can be relayed between devices and dereferenced as
   required.

   It is anticipated that implementation the NOWP protocol will often
   (although not necessarily always) form part of broader functionality
   to allow remote control and introspection of a device.  For this
   reason, the NOWP protocol is based upon HTTP [RFC2616] and can co-
   exist with most other HTTP-based applications.

3.  Advertisment

   The NOWP protocol is advertised to other devices on a local network
   using Multicast DNS [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns] in combination
   with DNS-based Service Discovery [I-D.cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd].

   This document defines a service type [DNSSD-SRV] of "nowp".  That is,
   registrations occur using the name "_nowp._tcp" and SHOULD by default
   be restricted to the link-local scope.  Devices SHOULD make the
   service available via both IPv4 and IPv6 and advertise the service
   accordingly.  The NOWP protocol specification places no particular
   requirement upon port numbering.  Devices SHOULD allow the host name
   used in advertisements to be customised by the device's owner where
   possible.

   Service advertisements MUST include a TXT record whose data is in the
   following format, given as Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) as
   specified by [RFC4234]:

   txt-record  =  "txtvers=1 path=" path-absolute

   "path-absolute" is defined as it is in .

   Clients MUST disregard advertisements which do not include a TXT
   record.  Clients MUST disregard advertisements which do not match the
   above format, including where the value of the txtvers parameter is
   not "1".

4.  Now Playing inquiry request

   Once a client has discovered a device advertising the NOWP protocol,
   it may connect to it in order to inquire as to the media currently
   playing on the device.

   The request takes the form of an ordinary HTTP request, where:

   o  The Host request header MUST be specified as the fully-qualified
      domain name of the PTR record advertised by the device.

   o  The HTTP method used MUST be "GET"

   o  The request path is the value of the "path" parameter from the
      advertisement's TXT record.

   o  Clients SHOULD request that the connection is kept alive (via the
      "Connection: keep-alive" request header) where repeated periodic
      queries are anticipated.

5.  Now Playing inquiry response

   Devices respond to the Now Playing inquiry request with an HTTP 2xx
   status code.  Devices MAY include a response body, but SHOULD respond
   with a "204 No Content" status if none is included.  Clients MUST
   consider any 2xx or 3xx status code as indicative of a successful
   response.

   Devices SHOULD require clients to authenticate themselves before
   information may be returned.  The details of appropriate
   authentication mechanisms are outside of the scope of this document.

   For the purposes of the NOWP protocol, clients MUST ignore any
   response body, and MUST NOT follow URIs given in any "Location"
   response headers which might be returned.

   Devices relay URIs to clients by means of a "Link" response header
   [I-D.nottingham-http-link-header].  The NOWP protocol specifies two
   Link Relation values which SHALL be used:

   http://purl.org/ontology/po/Channel
      This relation indicates that the linked resource is a service URI
      -- that is, a URI which identifies a service which delivers
      content to the device, such as a television station or a podcast.

   http://purl.org/ontology/po/Broadcast
      This relation indicates that the linked resource identifies a
      particular event, such as a radio programme or a locally-stored
      video file.

   Devices MAY provide multiple URIs for a service or event but MUST NOT
   provide URIs for more than one service or more than one event.
   Devices MAY omit URIs for either current service, current event, or
   both.  Devices SHOULD NOT include URIs with link relations of either
   http://projectbaird.com/ns/service or
   http://projectbaird.com/ns/event where the URI is known not to be
   meaningful beyond the device itself except where the device provides
   some other service which might make use of that URI in order to
   provide further information about the service or resource.

   Links with a relation of http://projectbaird.com/ns/event MAY include
   two additional parameters, described below.  Devices SHOULD include
   these parameters if the relevant information is available, but MAY
   omit either or both of them.

   scheduledStart
      Specifies that the event, which was (or is being) received from a
      linear broadcast medium had a start time specified in the device's
      Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) as indicated by the value of the
      parameter.  The parameter is a Datetime value in the format
      described below.

   scheduledDuration
      Specifies that the event has a duration specified in the device's
      Electronic Programme Guide as indicated by the value of the
      parameter.  The parameter is a Duration value in the format
      described below.

5.1.  Datetime value format

   The Datetime format is a compatible subset of the combined date and
   time format described in Chapter 5 of ISO 8601 and has the format:

   datetime  =  date "T" time "Z"

   date      =  year "-" month "-" day

   time      =  hour ":" minute [ ":" "second" ]

   year      =  4 DIGIT

   month     =  2 DIGIT

   day       =  2 DIGIT

   hour      =  2 DIGIT

   minute    =  2 DIGIT

   second    =  2 DIGIT

   Dates and times expressed in this format do not convey timezone or
   offset information; all times must be given in UTC.

   NOTE: Per [RFC4234] and ISO 8601, the "T" and "Z" characters in this
   syntax may alternatively be lower case "t" or "z" respectively.

5.2.  Duration value format

5.3.  Service and event URIs

   The exact nature of a service or event URI is, in effect, an
   implementation detail, but some guidelines are given here.

   Service URIs are intended to allow the identification by devices
   other than the receiver of the service, and in particular by
   Internet-based applications which those devices might communicate
   with.  A service which is delivered by way of DVB-T transmissions
   might use a URI which is made up of identifying values embedded in
   the transmissions themselves; a service delivered using RTP via
   multicast IP might instead be identified by the advertised URL of the
   SDP document describing the stream.

   Where a scheme (such as [RADIODNS]) exists which provides a means to
   generate DNS domain names for a given broadcast service, devices
   SHOULD provide "dns" URIs as per [RFC4501].
