 Resolution service for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) identifying
                               broadcasts
                    draft-mcroberts-uri-resolver-00

Abstract

   This document describes a service which accepts information,
   including URIs, which identify television and radio broadcasts and
   returns a canonical URL which can be used to retrieve metadata
   relating to the broadcast.

1.  Introduction

   In order for devices to retrieve metadata relating to broadcast
   television or radio programmes, one of two mechanisms must be
   employed: either the location of related metadata must be transmitted
   alongside or embedded within the programme itself, or alternately a
   means must be available which allows metadata to be discovered based
   upon information which is already available as part of the broadcast
   stream.  The service described in this document is intended for use
   with the latter mechanism.

   In order to achieve this, the resolution service is specified as a
   web service -- that is, an application made available via the HTTP
   protocol [RFC 2616] which accepts a defined set of parameters
   relating to the broadcast and returns a 301 Permanent Redirect
   response providing to the programme metadata URL.

   Because those best-placed to provide this service are the
   organisations who broadcast the programmes in the first place, user
   agents locate instances of the service using RadioDNS [RadioDNS] or
   TVDNS [TVDNS] (itself an extension of RadioDNS).

   In combination with the RadioDNS/TVDNS hostname, a user agent
   supplies parameters to the service which are formulated based upon
   the information which is available to it regarding the programme.
   For example, a crid URI [RFC 4078] might be available.  Alternately,
   a medium-specific URI of some kind might be available (such as a dvb
   URI [ETSI TS 102 851]).

   Once a user agent receives a metadata URL, it is free to use it as
   the application dictates: it might simply record the URL for later
   use, or use it as a means of identifying the programme to other
   applications, or it might make a request to it in order to retrieve
   programme metadata, or it might do none of these things.  The
   semantics of the resource linked to by this URL are outside of the
   scope of this document and will be specified separately.

2.  Service discovery

   Discovery of an instance of the resolver is accomplished by way of
   RadioDNS [RDNS01] or TVDNS [TVDNS] (an extension to RadioDNS).  This
   specification defines a service name of "broadcast-meta".

   In other words, once a RadioDNS fully-qualified domain name (FQDN)
   has been constructed relating to the broadcast service and DNS
   queries performed against it as per [RDNS01], a user agent shall
   query for SRV records named "_broadcast-meta._tcp" beneath the target
   of the FQDN if it is a CNAME, or else the FQDN itself.

   A matching TXT record MUST also be published in DNS alongside the SRV
   record(s).  The content of the TXT record takes the form:

   txtvers=1 path=<path>

   The value and purpose of <path> is defined below.

3.  Resolution requests

   Requests to the resolver take the form of HTTP requests [RFC 2616],
   with the following constraints:

   o  The HTTP method MUST be "GET"

   o  The "Host:" request header MUST be set to the RadioDNS FQDN
      relating to the broadcast service (and so was used to discover the
      resolution service)

   o  The request SHOULD NOT include body content

   o  The request URI MUST be formulated as described below in
      Section 3.1

3.1.  Formulating a request URI

   Request URIs take the general form (expressed as an Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (ABNF) notation fragment:

   request-uri =  path separator param-set

   param-set   =  first-param *( "&" uri-param ) time-params

   first-param =  initial-sep uri-param

   uri-param   =  "uri[]=" value

   time-params =  [ "&" start-param ] [ "&" dur-param ] [ "&" tt-param ]

   start-param =  "start=" datetime

   dur-param   =  "duration=" duration

   tt-param    =  "tranmissionTime=" duration

   initial-sep =  "?" / "&"

   value       =  unreserved / pct-encoded

   datetime    =  date "T" time "Z"

   duration    =  "PT" hours "H" minutes "M" [ seconds "S" ]

   date        =  year "-" month "-" day

   time        =  hours "%3A" minutes [ "%3A" seconds ]

   year        =  4 DIGIT

   month       =  2 DIGIT

   day         =  2 DIGIT

   hours       =  2 DIGIT

   minutes     =  2 DIGIT

   seconds     =  2 DIGIT
