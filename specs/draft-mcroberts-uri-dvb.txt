Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme for Digital Video Broadcasting
                       (DVB) Programme Resources
                       draft-mcroberts-uri-dvb-05

Abstract

   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme
   resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems]
   have been devised in their process of creating standards by the
   Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), the Association of Radio
   Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the OpenCable
   Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled
   publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications
   such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based
   metadata.

   These URI locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other multimedia
   broadcast programme service (i.e. channel or event) and the audio-
   visual components conforming to that programme for e.g. a HTTP based
   programme guide in the internet or other XML based programme guides
   in digital broadcast set-top boxes.

   This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the
   Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video
   Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.

1.  Introduction

   Standards governing televisions, set-top boxes and other consumer
   electronics devices have for some time been developed with the
   Internet in mind.  The use of Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [RFC3986] is now commonplace, including for the purpose of
   identifying resources delivered by way of terrestrial, satellite and
   cable broadcasts.

   For this purpose, a URI scheme was developed as part of the Digital
   Video Broadcasting [DVB] suite of standards specifically for the
   purpose of identifying broadcasts delivered by way of DVB-compliant
   broadcasting systems.

   With the advent of digital broadcasting, digital multimedia broadcast
   services to the home, based on MPEG-2 Transport Streams
   [MPEG-Systems] have been widely available in recent years.  Each
   broadcasting programme and composing components (i.e. audio-visual
   and generic data components) are identifiable in the MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream.  TV/Radio broadcasting programmes within MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream packets can be delivered over an IP network as well as over a
   digital broadcast network.

   The EPG (Electronic Programme Guide) service for TV/Radio programmes
   by which people are able to search-select and acquire the favorite
   programme, must be able to locate selected programme or service in a
   canonical form.  This programme guide is now available on web servers
   through the internet or im metadata services within the digital
   broadcasting service to identify the actual broadcast programme
   material for such advanced broadcasting services.

   This document defines the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes
   for broadcast programme resources over MPEG-2 Transport Stream
   [MPEG-Systems] for DVB services, in conformance with the generic URI
   syntax [RFC3986] to have a high affinity with IP networks.

   The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led
   consortium of over 270 broadcasters, manufacturers, network
   operators, software developers, regulatory bodies and others in over
   35 countries committed to designing global standards for the global
   delivery of digital television and data services.  Services using DVB
   standards are available on every continent with a total of more than
   500 million DVB receivers already deployed.  More information on DVB
   can be found on their website at http://www.dvb.org

   This URI specification is for a permanent assignment.

1.1.  Terminology

   *MPEG-2 Transport Stream:* Transport Stream defined in the MPEG-2
   standard [MPEG-Systems], a method of transmission at the MPEG-2 level
   using TS Packets.  It represents level 2 of the ISO/OSI reference
   model.

   *MPEG-2 standard:* A set of standards specified by the Motion Picture
   Experts Group (MPEG), and published by the International Standards
   Organisation (ISO)

1.2.  Transmission Scheme

   The Audio, Visual or Private data components constituting the TV/
   Radio programme (SERVICE) are defined as elementary stream
   components.  And these constituted TV/Radio programmes (SERVICEs) are
   bundled in a TRANSPORT STREAM (e.g. channel) for delivering over a
   single BROADCASTING NETWORK (e.g.  Satellite, Cable or Terrestrial).
   The distinguished unique number for each packet, elementary
   component, transport stream and transmission network is assigned and
   transmitted over the satellite, cable or terrestrial broadcasting
   media, even over the IP network, together with the information table
   which describes these assigned numbers in the form of MPEG-2 standard
   [MPEG-Systems].

2.  Digital Video Broadcasting URI Scheme

   The DVB URI is defined by [DVB-URI], and that shall be considered the
   authoritative source of the definition of the scheme-specific-part of
   the DVB URI.

   URIs employing the dvb scheme are URLs.  DVB URLs may refer to any of
   the following kinds of resource:

   o  A DVB service

   o  Components within a DVB service (such as an audio or video stream)

   o  An event (for example, a programme)

   o  A transport stream

   o  A file contained within a DSM-CC object carousel

   o  Interactive applications

2.1.  Syntax

   This URI scheme is in conformance with the generic URI syntax
   [RFC3986].  It takes the form:

   MPEG-2_TS_URI       = transmission_scheme ":" path

   transmission_scheme = "dvb"

   path                = [ "//" broadcast_auth_domain ] comp_path

2.1.1.  transmission_scheme

   The transmission_scheme name represents the transmission system using
   the MPEG-2 standard in the digital broadcasting service in accordance
   with Section 3.1 of [RFC3986].

   In this definition "dvb" represents the DVB system which is based on
   [BT.1306], [BO.1516], [J.83], and [DVB-IPTV].

2.1.2.  broadcast_auth_domain

   The broadcast_auth_domain includes the unique number to which a
   government authority or approved organization govern for the sake of
   preserving uniqueness.  Hence broadcast_auth_domain allows to
   identify a specific broadcasting company or service in the digital
   broadcasting network.  The unique number in broadcast_auth_domain

Internet-Draft                URIs for DVB                 November 2010


   consists of a sequence of characters separated by ".", which is
   preceded by a double slash ("//") and terminated by a slash ("/").

   broadcast_auth_domain = 0*255 ( unreserved | sub-delims )

   unreserved            = ALPHA | DIGIT | "-" | "." | "_" | "~"

   sub-delims            = "!" | "$" | "&" | "'" | "(" | ")" |
                           "*" | "+" | "," | ";" | "="

   This broadcast_auth_domain consists of unique name in the digital
   broadcasting network conforming to the URI.

2.1.3.  comp_path

   The comp_path indicates the unique number of the audio, visual and
   private data component(s) constituting a broadcast programme or event
   and is assigned in each broadcasting company or authority for
   preserving uniqueness in a sequence of TV/Radio programmes in one
   channel.  The broadcast_auth_domain identifies the broadcast
   programme (e.g. channel or specific programme event) and comp_path
   determines the component of the broadcasting programme.

   comp_path consists of a sequence of characters separated by a slash
   ("/") to indicate the audio, visual and private data component(s)
   within the scope of the broadcast authority indicated in the
   broadcast_auth_domain.

   comp_path = *( "/" segment )

   segment   = *pchar

   pchar     = unreserved | pct-encoded | sub-delims | ":" | "@"

   comp_path can be structured in hierarchical or non-hierarchical form
   to identify particular programme not only audio, visual and private
   data component over the MPEG-2 Transport Stream.

2.2.  Encoding

   Section 5 of [DVB-URI] specifies that:

   "All characters not within the range of characters allowed in a URI
   must be encoded into UTF-8 and included in the URI as a sequence of
   escaped octets.  An escaped octet is encoded as a character triplet,
   consisting of the percent character "%" followed by the two
   hexadecimal digits representing the octet code."

2.3.  Community Considerations

2.3.1.  Context of Use

   The "dvb" URIs are used as references to resources in digitial
   multimedia programmes, most often within the context of DVB itself:
   interactive television applications use them in order to locate
   resources and to reference services and programmes.  These are
   typically broadcast via satellite, cable and terrestrial systems, but
   may also be retrieved on-demand from a server via the Internet.
   Providers of such broadcast services may e.g. reference programmes in
   the broadcast from an Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) which is
   published on their web- site.  On another example, the metadata which
   is part of the multimedia broadcasts can also contain such URIs to
   establish hyperlinks between broadcast services.  This might for
   instance include multi-angle video services (e.g. for sports events).
   Users of suitably equipepd clients - i.e. with a suitable tuner card
   and software installed (Open Source tools include e.g.
   http://www.linuxtv.org/ and http://www.mythtv.org/) - are able to
   exchange such URIs (e.g. via an instant messaging service or email)
   to provide each other clickable hyperlinks to multimedia content they
   deem of interest.

   DVB has published specifications for the distribution of multimedia
   services via IP unicast and multicast mechanisms.  In this context,
   such URIs are usable in any player client software (no tuner card
   required) that implements the respective protocols and has the
   relevant audio and video codecs installed.

   o  For example, a receiver connected to a local area network might
      allow other devices to query it for information regarding the
      current programme or service: in this context, a dvb URI would
      typically be the most authoritative single identifier which could
      be used to to refer to that programme.

   o  Similarly, a web service could be implemented by a platform
      operator or a broadcaster (or some party working on their behalf)
      which allows resolution of dvb URIs - this would allow a device to
      retrieve web pages or other content which relate to the current
      programme (or some other entry in the device's Electronic
      Programme Guide).

   Implementing such a system naturally requires some mechanism for
   devices to discover an appropriate resolution service.  DVB has
   developed has developed a service discovery and selection (SD&S)
   solution as part of [DVB-IPTV].

2.3.2.  Resolution Considerations

   The resolution is determined through the process of development of
   DVB standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB).

   Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices
   with quite different access methods and capabilities, no single
   resolution or delegation mechanism can be referenced in this
   document.

   Currently 2 client system classes are covered by DVB specifications:

   o  A broadcast set-top box which only has a unidirectional, receive-
      only connection.  Hence all DVB URIs need to be resolvable from
      the service discovery information received in the broadcast
      stream.

   o  A "home network end device" (HNED) which could be an IPTV set-top
      box, networked TV or personal digital recorder with an Ethernet or
      WLAN connection to a home gateway device.

   Further device classes will be addressed as DVB standardisation
   progresses.  The dvb URIs must however remain valid.  DVB will define
   appropriate resolution mechanisms to ensure that DVB URIs remain
   valid for those new device classes as well.

   For the two above example device classes, 3 ways of conveying such
   resolution information are currently defined by DVB:

   o  Repeated, cyclic transmission of service discovery information as
      auxiliary data in digital TV broadcast streams over satellite,
      cable or terrestrial transmissions according to [DVB-SI],
      [DVB-DATA] and [DVB-TVA].

   o  Repeated, cyclic multicast transmission of SD&S Records via the
      DVBSTP protocol according to [DVB-IPTV].

   o  Unicast delivery of SD&S Records in response to HTTP "GET /dvb/
      sdns" requests according to [DVB-IPTV].

2.3.3.  Implementation Considerations

2.3.3.1.  Considerations for resolution server software

   With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB will establish
   requirements and seek candidates for operating resolution servers as
   appropriate.

Internet-Draft                URIs for DVB                 November 2010


   To boot-strap the resolution process, a DVB client needs to discover
   an entry point (or set of) from which to obtain an initial Service
   Discovery and Selection XML record:

   o  By default, the service discovery information is provided on the
      IANA registered well-known port dvbservdsc (port number 3937) via
      tcp and udp (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers) on
      the IANA registered well-known multicast addresses 224.0.23.14
      (DvbServDisc on IPv4) and FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D (DvbServDisc on
      IPv6).

   o  As set forth in [DVB-IPTV], a list of non-default Service
      Discovery and Selection (SD&S) entry points addresses may also be
      provided via DNS based on the service location resource record
      (SRV RR) [RFC2782].  The service name for DVB services is
      "_dvbservdsc", the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of
      the name is the domain name maintained by DVB for service
      discovery.  This domain name is set to "services.dvb.org".  The
      DVB organization will maintain the services.dvb.org domain name
      for service discovery and new service providers should register
      with DVB to add them to the DNS SRV list.

2.3.3.2.  Considerations for resolution client software

   To obtain the initial Service Discovery and Selection (SD&S) XML
   record, a client must by default first join the IANA registered well-
   known multicast addresses 224.0.23.14 (DvbServDisc on IPv4) and/or
   FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D (DvbServDisc on IPv6) and try to obtain a boot-
   strap record from the IANA registered well-known port dvbservdsc
   (port number 3937) via tcp and udp (see
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers).

   To discover non-default entry points addresses, [DVB-IPTV] defines
   that a list of Service Discovery and Selection (SD&S) entry points
   addresses may be acquired via DNS according to the service location
   resource record (SRV RR) [RFC2782].  The service name is
   "_dvbservdsc", the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of the
   name is the domain name maintained by DVB for service discovery.
   This domain name is set to "services.dvb.org".  So the lookup shall
   be either "_dvbservdsc._tcp.services.dvb.org" or
   "_dvbservdsc._udp.services.dvb.org".  This requires that the terminal
   support an SRV cognizant DNS client and according to the
   specification in [RFC2782].  The DVB organization will maintain the
   services.dvb.org domain name for service discovery.  HTTP servers
   will be found via the tcp protocol method whilst the multicast
   addresses will be found via the udp protocol method.

3.2.  Security Considerations

   Section 7 of [RFC3986] describes general security considerations for
   URI schemes.  The sections relating to reliability and consistency,
   malicious construction, back-end transcoding, rare IP address formats
   and semantic attacks all apply to dvb URIs.  The section relating to
   sensitive information does not apply, given that dvb URIs do not
   contain authentication information.

   The security considerations of the Digital Video Broadcasting suite
   of standards in general are not covered in this document.
