Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) Scheme for Digital Video Broadcasting
                       (DVB) Programme Resources
                       draft-mcroberts-uri-dvb-05

Abstract

   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme
   resources transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams [MPEG-Systems]
   have been devised in their process of creating standards by the
   Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), the Association of Radio
   Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the OpenCable
   Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled
   publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications
   such as HTTP, MHP [DVB-MHP], OCAP [OCAP1.0] or other XML based
   metadata.

   These URI locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other multimedia
   broadcast programme service (i.e. channel or event) and the audio-
   visual components conforming to that programme for e.g. a HTTP based
   programme guide in the internet or other XML based programme guides
   in digital broadcast set-top boxes.

   This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the
   Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video
   Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.

1.  Introduction

   Standards governing televisions, set-top boxes and other consumer
   electronics devices have for some time been developed with the
   Internet in mind.  The use of Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [RFC3986] is now commonplace, including for the purpose of
   identifying resources delivered by way of terrestrial, satellite and
   cable broadcasts.

   For this purpose, a URI scheme was developed as part of the Digital
   Video Broadcasting [DVB] suite of standards specifically for the
   purpose of identifying broadcasts delivered by way of DVB-compliant
   broadcasting systems.

   With the advent of digital broadcasting, digital multimedia broadcast
   services to the home, based on MPEG-2 Transport Streams
   [MPEG-Systems] have been widely available in recent years.  Each
   broadcasting programme and composing components (i.e. audio-visual
   and generic data components) are identifiable in the MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream.  TV/Radio broadcasting programmes within MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream packets can be delivered over an IP network as well as over a
   digital broadcast network.

   The EPG (Electronic Programme Guide) service for TV/Radio programmes
   by which people are able to search-select and acquire the favorite
   programme, must be able to locate selected programme or service in a
   canonical form.  This programme guide is now available on web servers
   through the internet or im metadata services within the digital
   broadcasting service to identify the actual broadcast programme
   material for such advanced broadcasting services.

   This document defines the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes
   for broadcast programme resources over MPEG-2 Transport Stream
   [MPEG-Systems] for DVB services, in conformance with the generic URI
   syntax [RFC3986] to have a high affinity with IP networks.

   The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led
   consortium of over 270 broadcasters, manufacturers, network
   operators, software developers, regulatory bodies and others in over
   35 countries committed to designing global standards for the global
   delivery of digital television and data services.  Services using DVB
   standards are available on every continent with a total of more than
   500 million DVB receivers already deployed.  More information on DVB
   can be found on their website at http://www.dvb.org

   This URI specification is for a permanent assignment.

1.1.  Transmission Scheme

   The audio, visual or private data components constituting a TV/radio
   programme ("service") are defined as elementary stream (ES)
   components.  Several of these TV/radio programmes are bundled in a
   transport stream (TS) multiplex for delivering over a broadcast
   transmission network (e.g. satellite, cable or terrestrial).  The
   distinguished unique number for each TS mux packet, elementary stream
   component, transport stream and transmission network is assigned and
   transmitted over the satellite, cable or terrestrial broadcasting
   media, even over the IP network, together with the information table
   which describes these assigned numbers in the form of MPEG-2 standard
   [MPEG-Systems].

           Programme Delivery Scheme in MPEG-2 Transport Stream

   All these elements are unambiguously identified in DVB systems by
   numerical ids:

   o  A *network_id* identifies a broadcast transmission network.  On
      satellite and IP broadband, typically one network_id corresponds
      to an operator.  On cable and terrestrial, where different radio
      frequencies might be used in different regions, operators
      typically use one network_id per such region.

Internet-Draft                URIs for DVB                  January 2011


   o  An *original_network_id* is used where TV/radio programmes are
      taken from one network, and are re-transmitted on another one.  To
      enable receivers detecting that a programme is identical to
      another one, the original_network_id is used to indicate from
      which network the programme originates.

   o  A *transport_stream_id* is used to refer to a time-domain
      multiplex of several programmes carried in TS packets.  One or
      more multiplexes can be transmitted on any given radio frequency
      in a DVB network.

   o  A *service_id* identifies a TV/radio or data programme within a TS
      multiplex.  The number of programmes is limited by the capacity of
      the underlying physical channel.

   o  A *component_tag* identifies an elementary stream (ES) of video,
      audio, teletext, subtitles, or other data within a service.

          Relationship of Network, Transport Stream, and Service

   The original_network_id is an attribute of a transport stream (TS).
   In the simplest case, all services originate from the network on
   which they are transmitted.  Then, the original_network_id of all the
   TS will be equal to the network_id.  This typically happens on
   networks operated by public broadcasters.  If one of the public
   broadcaster's TS is for instance re-transmitted by a cable operator,
   the information about this TS would indicate the cable operator's
   network_id, and the original_network_id of the public broadcaster.
   Hence all assigned network_id values must represent actual broadcast
   network infrastructures, whereas this is not required for
   original_network_id values.  A globally active content provider may
   for example choose to register an original_network_id, and distribute
   pre-multiplexed TS to broadcasters, without operating any broadcast
   network of its own.

   Both, the original_network_id and the network_id are coordinated by
   the DVB Project.  The DVB Project in turn has delegated the
   management of DVB identifiers to DVB Services Sarl [DVB-SVCS].  DVB
   Services maintains a public register of all assignments, and accepts
   requests for new assignments on their website.

   Due to the way broadcast transmission networks are operated, some
   relationships exist between these identifiers:

   o  Each TS is part of exactly one orginial_network_id (see above).

   o  Hence, each TS is unambiguously identified by the tuple
      {original_network_id, transport_stream_id}.

   o  According to [DVB-SI-SPEC], each service_id is unique within a TS.
      Hence a service is unambiguously identified by the tuple
      {original_network_id, transport_stream_id, service_id}.

   o  [DVB-SI-GDL] additionally requires that each service_id be unique
      within an original_network_id.  Hence, in areas where [DVB-SI-GDL]
      has been made part of the broadcast profile, the tuple
      {original_network_id, service_id} unambiguously identifies a
      service.

   During a scan run, a receiver will pick up information about TS.  It
   will learn their transport_stream_id, original_network_id and
   network_id.  Since it scans different radio frequency channels, it is
   able to link these identifiers to radio frequencies and other
   modulation parameters.  On [DVB-IPTV], of course no radio frquencies
   are used.  The model of broadcasters, networks, and services is
   however maintained.  Hence a [DVB-IPTV] receiver uses the same
   identifiers with the above semantics to identify services.

   Finally, a DVB service is composed of one or more components.  These
   are identified within the service by their component_tag.  A
   component can be either an elementary stream (ES) carrying video,
   audio, teletext, subtitles, or other synchronised data, or generic
   data (see also [DVB-DATA], [DVB-TVA] and [DVB-MHP]).  Each of these
   components is then sliced into fragments and packetised in TS packets
   [MPEG-Systems].  All packets for a given component are labeled with
   the same TS packet identifier (PID), effectively providing a virtual
   channel in the TS for the component.  All packtes are then
   multiplexed in the time domain according ot each component's data
   rate requirements, and the resulting TS is passed to the transmission
   equipment.  For examples how these identifiers are used, please refer
   to Section 2.5.

   PID values according to [MPEG-Systems] and [DVB-SI-SPEC].  These
   metadata TS packets are not shown in the above figure.

2.  Digital Video Broadcasting URI Scheme

   The DVB URI is defined by [DVB-URI], and that shall be considered the
   authoritative source of the definition of the scheme-specific-part of
   the DVB URI.

   URIs employing the dvb scheme are URLs.  DVB URLs may refer to any of
   the following kinds of resource:

   o  A DVB service

   o  Components within a DVB service (such as an audio or video stream)

   o  An event (for example, a programme)

   o  A transport stream

   o  A file contained within a DSM-CC object carousel

   o  Interactive applications

2.1.  Syntax

   This URI scheme is in conformance with the generic URI syntax
   [RFC3986].  It takes the form:

   MPEG-2_TS_URI       = transmission_scheme ":" path

   transmission_scheme = "dvb"

   path                = [ "//" broadcast_auth_domain ] comp_path

2.1.1.  transmission_scheme

   The transmission_scheme name represents the transmission system using
   the MPEG-2 standard in the digital broadcasting service in accordance
   with Section 3.1 of [RFC3986].

   In this definition "dvb" represents the DVB system which is based on
   [BT.1306], [BO.1516], [J.83], and [DVB-IPTV].

2.1.2.  broadcast_auth_domain

   The broadcast_auth_domain includes the unique number to which a
   government authority or approved organization govern for the sake of
   preserving uniqueness.  Hence broadcast_auth_domain allows to
   identify a specific broadcasting company or service in the digital
   broadcasting network.  The unique number in broadcast_auth_domain

   consists of a sequence of characters separated by ".", which is
   preceded by a double slash ("//") and optionally terminated by a
   slash ("/").

   broadcast_auth_domain = 0*255 ( unreserved | sub-delims )

   unreserved            = ALPHA | DIGIT | "-" | "." | "_" | "~"

   sub-delims            = "!" | "$" | "&" | "'" | "(" | ")" |
                           "*" | "+" | "," | ";" | "="

   This broadcast_auth_domain consists of a unique name in the digital
   broadcasting network conforming to the URI.

2.1.3.  comp_path

   The comp_path indicates the unique identification of the audio,
   visual and data component(s) constituting a broadcast programme or
   event.  It can also be structured in hierarchical or non-hierarchical
   form to identify particular programmes of a service.  It is assigned
   in each broadcasting company or authority for preserving uniqueness
   in a sequence of TV/radio programmes in one service.  The
   broadcast_auth_domain identifies the broadcast programme (e.g.
   channel or specific programme event) and comp_path determines the
   component(s) of the broadcasting programme.

   comp_path consists of a sequence of characters, optionally separated
   by a slash ("/"), to indicate the audio, visual and data component(s)
   within the scope of the broadcast authority indicated in the
   broadcast_auth_domain.

   comp_path = *( "/" segment )

   segment   = *pchar

   pchar     = unreserved | pct-encoded | sub-delims | ":" | "@"

2.2.  Encoding

   Section 5 of [DVB-URI] specifies that:

   "All characters not within the range of characters allowed in a URI
   must be encoded into UTF-8 and included in the URI as a sequence of
   escaped octets.  An escaped octet is encoded as a character triplet,
   consisting of the percent character "%" followed by the two
   hexadecimal digits representing the octet code."

2.3.  Community Considerations

2.3.1.  Context of Use

   The "dvb" URIs are used as references to resources in digitial
   multimedia programmes, most often within the context of DVB itself:
   interactive television applications use them in order to locate
   resources and to reference services and programmes.  These are
   typically broadcast via satellite, cable and terrestrial systems, but
   may also be retrieved on-demand from a server via the Internet.
   Providers of such broadcast services may e.g. reference programmes in
   the broadcast from an Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) which is
   published on their web- site.  On another example, the metadata which
   is part of the multimedia broadcasts can also contain such URIs to
   establish hyperlinks between broadcast services.  This might for
   instance include multi-angle video services (e.g. for sports events).
   Users of suitably equipepd clients - i.e. with a suitable tuner card
   and software installed (Open Source tools include e.g.
   http://www.linuxtv.org/ and http://www.mythtv.org/) - are able to
   exchange such URIs (e.g. via an instant messaging service or email)
   to provide each other clickable hyperlinks to multimedia content they
   deem of interest.

   DVB has published specifications for the distribution of multimedia
   services via IP unicast and multicast mechanisms.  In this context,
   such URIs are usable in any player client software (no tuner card
   required) that implements the respective protocols and has the
   relevant audio and video codecs installed.

   o  For example, a receiver connected to a local area network might
      allow other devices to query it for information regarding the
      current programme or service: in this context, a dvb URI would
      typically be the most authoritative single identifier which could
      be used to to refer to that programme.

   o  Similarly, a web service can be implemented by a platform operator
      or a broadcaster (or some party working on their behalf) which
      allows resolution of dvb URIs - this would allow a device to
      retrieve web pages or other content which relate to the current
      programme (or some other entry in the device's Electronic
      Programme Guide).

   Implementing such a system naturally requires some mechanism for
   devices to discover an appropriate resolution service.  DVB has
   developed has developed a service discovery and selection (SD&S)
   solution as part of [DVB-IPTV].

Internet-Draft                URIs for DVB                  January 2011


2.3.2.  Resolution Considerations

   The resolution is determined through the process of development of
   DVB standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB).

   Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices
   with quite different access methods and capabilities, no single
   resolution or delegation mechanism can be referenced in this
   document.

   Currently 2 client system classes are covered by DVB specifications:

   o  A broadcast set-top box which only has a unidirectional, receive-
      only connection.  Hence all DVB URIs need to be resolvable from
      the service discovery information received in the broadcast
      stream.

   o  A "home network end device" (HNED) which could be an IPTV set-top
      box, networked TV or personal digital recorder with an Ethernet or
      WLAN connection to a home gateway device.

   Further device classes will be addressed as DVB standardisation
   progresses.  The dvb URIs must however remain valid.  DVB will define
   appropriate resolution mechanisms to ensure that DVB URIs remain
   valid for those new device classes as well.

   For the two above example device classes, 3 ways of conveying such
   resolution information are currently defined by DVB:

   o  Repeated, cyclic transmission of service discovery information as
      auxiliary data in digital TV broadcast streams over satellite,
      cable or terrestrial transmissions according to [DVB-SI-SPEC],
      [DVB-DATA] and [DVB-TVA].

   o  Repeated, cyclic multicast transmission of SD&S Records via the
      DVBSTP protocol according to [DVB-IPTV].

   o  Unicast delivery of SD&S Records in response to HTTP "GET /dvb/
      sdns" requests according to [DVB-IPTV].

2.3.3.  Implementation Considerations

2.3.3.1.  Considerations for resolution server software

   With on-going development of DVB standards, DVB will establish
   requirements and seek candidates for operating resolution servers as
   appropriate.

Internet-Draft                URIs for DVB                  January 2011


   To boot-strap the resolution process, a DVB client needs to discover
   an entry point (or set of) from which to obtain an initial Service
   Discovery and Selection XML record:

   o  By default, the service discovery information is provided on the
      IANA registered well-known port dvbservdsc (port number 3937) via
      tcp and udp (see http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers) on
      the IANA registered well-known multicast addresses 224.0.23.14
      (DvbServDisc on IPv4) and FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D (DvbServDisc on
      IPv6).

   o  As set forth in [DVB-IPTV], a list of non-default Service
      Discovery and Selection (SD&S) entry points addresses may also be
      provided via DNS based on the service location resource record
      (SRV RR) [RFC2782].  The service name for DVB services is
      "_dvbservdsc", the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of
      the name is the domain name maintained by DVB for service
      discovery.  This domain name is set to "services.dvb.org".  The
      DVB organization will maintain the services.dvb.org domain name
      for service discovery and new service providers should register
      with DVB to add them to the DNS SRV list.

2.3.3.2.  Considerations for resolution client software

   To obtain the initial Service Discovery and Selection (SD&S) XML
   record, a client must by default first join the IANA registered well-
   known multicast addresses 224.0.23.14 (DvbServDisc on IPv4) and/or
   FF0X:0:0:0:0:0:0:12D (DvbServDisc on IPv6) and try to obtain a boot-
   strap record from the IANA registered well-known port dvbservdsc
   (port number 3937) via tcp and udp (see
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers).

   To discover non-default entry points addresses, [DVB-IPTV] defines
   that a list of Service Discovery and Selection (SD&S) entry points
   addresses may be acquired via DNS according to the service location
   resource record (SRV RR) [RFC2782].  The service name is
   "_dvbservdsc", the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of the
   name is the domain name maintained by DVB for service discovery.
   This domain name is set to "services.dvb.org".  So the lookup shall
   be either "_dvbservdsc._tcp.services.dvb.org" or
   "_dvbservdsc._udp.services.dvb.org".  This requires that the terminal
   support an SRV cognizant DNS client and according to the
   specification in [RFC2782].  The DVB organization will maintain the
   services.dvb.org domain name for service discovery.  HTTP servers
   will be found via the tcp protocol method whilst the multicast
   addresses will be found via the udp protocol method.

2.4.  Rights to Use Trademarks

   Conforming to section 7.4 of [RFC3978], the DVB Project who is the
   holder of various trademark and logo rights amongst others but not
   limited to the term "dvb", hereby grants IETF a perpetual license to
   use any such trademarks or service marks solely in exercising its
   rights to reproduce, publish and modify this IETF contribution.  This
   license does not authorize any IETF participant to use any trademark
   or service mark in connection with any product or service offering,
   but only in the context of IETF Documents and discussions.

2.5.  Examples

   These examples make heavy use of the identifiers defined by DVB to
   identify entities.  Please see Section 1 for an explanation of the
   concepts.

2.5.1.  Referring to transport streams and services

   In the below examples, a receiver uses the identifiers in the URI to
   search its internal database of radio frequencies and modulation
   parameters, which it built during a service scan run.  It uses the
   identifiers as keys to look up in the various tables.

   dvb://233a.1041
      The DVB transport stream multiplex with id 0x1041 and with
      original network id 0x233a.  This might be used by a broadcaster
      to provide an entry point to its service offering, without picking
      out any of his services in particular.

   dvb://233a.1041.10bf
      The DVB service with id 0x10bf in the DVB transport stream with id
      0x1041 and with original network id 0x233a.  This could be used as
      the link behind a "watch this now" button.

   dvb://233a..10bf
      The DVB service with id 0x10bf and with original network id
      0x233a.  This could be used as the link behind a "watch this now"
      button.  Note that compared to the previous example the transport
      stream id is omitted.  This is possible in areas where
      [DVB-SI-GDL] is applicable.

   dvb://'MetroTV'
      The DVB service named "MetroTV".  Note that as opposed to the
      previous example, the reference to the service's name is not
      necessarily unambiguous and requires more contextual information
      to be resolved.  For "speaking" or "promotional" URIs, [DVB-TVA]
      might be a more general alternative.

2.5.2.  Referring to service components

   In addition to referring to a TV/radio programme as a whole, it might
   be desirable to be able to pick out specific variations of audio and
   video provided by a programme.  One could for instance always be
   interested in the video with open signing, or in the audio for the
   visually impaired.

   dvb://233a.1041.10bf.audio=fra
      The default video stream and the French language audio stream in
      the indicated DVB service.

   dvb://233a.1041.10bf.audio=qaa&subtitles=eng
      The default video stream, the original language audio stream, and
      the English language subtitle stream in the indicated DVB service.

   dvb://233a.1041.10bf.video=default&audio=visually_impaired  The
      default video stream and the audio stream for the visually
      impaired in the indicated DVB service.

   dvb://233a.1041.10bf.fqc=50B,3&fqc=640,5,fra  The HD video stream
      (stream_content 0x5 and component_type 0x0B) with component_tag 3,
      and the French language ("fra") HE.AAC audio for the visually
      impaired (stream_content 0x6 and component_type 0x40) with
      component_tag 5.

2.5.3.  References for triggering

   Applications might want to trigger on the start and/or end of TV/
   radio programmes.  The user might e.g. have set a flag on the
   programme, so that the receiver will remind him when it begins, or
   might even automatically switch to the respective service when the
   programme begins, and back to the previous service whe it is over.
   Or a user might have selected a programme for recording.  These
   scenarios require that an application has some notion of the start
   and end times of TV/radio programmes.

   Creating accurate recordings of broadcast content is a non-trivial
   task.  For a wider discussion of this, please see [DVB-TVA].
   Although individual service components can be selected for recording,
   all components of the service should generally be recorded where
   appropriate.  This would for instance enable to use the original
   language audio instead of the dubbed version on special playback
   occasions.

   dvb://233a.1004.1044;8fff
      Event with id 0x8fff within the indicated DVB service.  A receiver
      would look up the EPG information for the given service, and for
      the indicated event within that service.  The EPG information will
      contain the wall-clock start time and duration of the programme as
      published e.g. also in print.  Since the actual times of
      transmission may be different, triggers should only be fired with
      appropriate lead-in and lead-out times relative to the published
      EPG times.  Receivers can also use additional information in the
      EPG, in particular the running_status.  Not all broadcasters do
      however manage the running_status reliably or in real-time.

   dvb://233a.1004.1044.audio=fra;8fff  French audio version of the
      event with id 0x8fff within the indicated DVB service.  The video
      would also be implied if it is a TV service.  See also previous
      example.

   dvb://233a.1004.1044;8fff~20100706T000315Z--PT00H31M17S
      Event with id 0x8fff within the indicated DVB service, starting at
      00 hours, 03 minutes and 15 seconds UTC on July, 6th, 2010,
      lasting for 00 hours, 31 minutes and 17 seconds.  This form of the
      URI can be used to convey more accurate transmission times for the
      content.  The programme may be advertised as starting at 00:00 and
      ending at 00:30 in the EPG.  This extended information in the
      locator can be used to get a much more accurate trigger for the
      programme.  The lead-in and lead-out times can be reduced to the
      minimum needed to account for the skews of the local and
      broadcaster clocks.

2.5.4.  Referring to data objects

   [DVB-DATA] defines - among other things - an object carousel which
   can be mounted as a file system.  The data for this object carousel
   is transmitted repeatedly.

   dvb://233a.1041.10bf/doc/form.pdf
      File in a subdirectory of an object carousel, for which the root
      object is carried in the default object carousel of the referenced
      DVB service.

   dvb:/image.png
      File in root directory of an object carousel, for which the root
      object is carried in the default object carousel of the current
      service.

   dvb://233a..10bf.3$10a1240f/doc/form.pdf
      File in a subdirectory of an object carousel, for which the root
      object has the transaction id 10a1240f and is carried in the ES
      with component_tag 3 of the referenced DVB service.  Note that
      compared to the first example the transport stream id is omitted.
      This is possible in areas where [DVB-SI-GDL] is applicable.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification requests the IANA provisionally register the "dvb"
   URI scheme as specified in this document and summarized in the
   following template, per [BCP115]:

3.1.  DVB Registration Template

   URI scheme name:  dvb

   Status:  Permanent

   URI scheme syntax:  See Section 2.

   URI scheme semantics:  See Section 2.

   Encoding considerations:  Conformance with RFC3986, no special
      considerations.

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:  dvb URIs are
      used throughout DVB-compliant broadcasting systems, for example
      within Freeview and Freesat in the United Kingdom.  They are also
      used in TV-Anytime [TV-Anytime] metadata where it relates to
      services transmitted by DVB systems.

   Interoperability considerations:  None.

   Security considerations:  See Section 3.2.

3.2.  Security Considerations

   Section 7 of [RFC3986] describes general security considerations for
   URI schemes.  The sections relating to reliability and consistency,
   malicious construction, back-end transcoding, rare IP address formats
   and semantic attacks all apply to dvb URIs.  The section relating to
   sensitive information does not apply, given that dvb URIs do not
   contain authentication information.

   The security considerations of the Digital Video Broadcasting suite
   of standards in general are not covered in this document.
