   Uniform Resource Identifiers for Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB)
                       draft-mcroberts-uri-dvb-00

Abstract

   This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the
   Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video
   Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.

Internet-Draft                URIs for DVB                     June 2010


1.  Introduction

   Standards governing televisions, set-top boxes and other consumer
   electronics devices have for some time been developed with the
   Internet in mind.  The use of Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [RFC 3986] is now commonplace, including for the purpose of
   identifying resources delivered by way of terrestrial, satellite and
   cable broadcasts.

   For this purpose, a URI scheme was developed as part of the Digital
   Video Broadcasting (DVB) suite of standards specifically for the
   purpose of identifying broadcasts delivered by way of DVB-compliant
   broadcasting systems.

2.  dvb URI Registration

   URI scheme name.
      dvb

   Status.
      provisional

   URI scheme syntax.
      See Table 1 of [ETSI TS 102 851]

   URI scheme semantics.
      The dvb scheme references services and resources which are
      transmitted using Digital Video Broadcasting-compliant
      broadcasting systems.

   Encoding considerations.
      See Section 5 of [ETSI TS 102 851]

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name.
      dvb URIs are used throughout DVB-compliant broadcasting systems,
      for example within Freeview and Freesat in the United Kingdom.
      They are also used in TV-Anytime [tva] metadata where it relates
      to services transmitted by DVB systems.

   Interoperability considerations.
      None known.

   Security considerations.
      Section 7 of [RFC 3986] describes general security considerations
      for URI schemes.  The sections relating to reliability and
      consistency, malicious construction, back-end transcoding, rare IP
      address formats and semantic attacks all apply to dvb URIs.  The
      section relating to sensitive information does not apply, given
      that dvb URIs do not contain authentication information.

3.  Digital Video Broadcasting URI

   The DVB URI is defined by [ETSI TS 102 851], and that shall be
   considered the authoritative source of the definition of the scheme-
   specific-part of the DVB URI.

   Registration will be submitted to IANA for the scheme described in
   Section 3.

5.  Security Considerations

   Section 7 of [RFC 3986] describes general security considerations for
   URI schemes.  The sections relating to reliability and consistency,
   malicious construction, back-end transcoding, rare IP address formats
   and semantic attacks all apply to dvb URIs.  The section relating to
   sensitive information does not apply, given that dvb URIs do not
   contain authentication information.

   The security considerations of the Digital Video Broadcasting suite
   of standards in general are not covered in this document.
