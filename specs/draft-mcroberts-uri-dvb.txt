   Uniform Resource Identifiers for Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB)
                       draft-mcroberts-uri-dvb-01

Abstract

   This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the
   Internet community, given its definition as part of the Digital Video
   Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI standards.

Internet-Draft                URIs for DVB                     July 2010


1.  Introduction

   Standards governing televisions, set-top boxes and other consumer
   electronics devices have for some time been developed with the
   Internet in mind.  The use of Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs)
   [RFC 3986] is now commonplace, including for the purpose of
   identifying resources delivered by way of terrestrial, satellite and
   cable broadcasts.

   For this purpose, a URI scheme was developed as part of the Digital
   Video Broadcasting (DVB) suite of standards specifically for the
   purpose of identifying broadcasts delivered by way of DVB-compliant
   broadcasting systems.

2.  dvb URI Registration

   URI scheme name.
      dvb

   Status.
      provisional

   URI scheme syntax.
      See Table 1 of [ETSI TS 102 851]

   URI scheme semantics.
      The dvb scheme references services and resources which are
      transmitted using Digital Video Broadcasting-compliant
      broadcasting systems.

   Encoding considerations.
      See Section 5 of [ETSI TS 102 851]

   Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name.
      dvb URIs are used throughout DVB-compliant broadcasting systems,
      for example within Freeview and Freesat in the United Kingdom.
      They are also used in TV-Anytime [tva] metadata where it relates
      to services transmitted by DVB systems.

   Interoperability considerations.
      None known.

   Security considerations.
      See Section 5.

3.  Digital Video Broadcasting URI

   The DVB URI is defined by [ETSI TS 102 851], and that shall be
   considered the authoritative source of the definition of the scheme-
   specific-part of the DVB URI.  The remainder of this section is
   therefore non-normative.

   URIs employing the dvb scheme are URLs.  DVB URLs may refer to any of
   the following kinds of resource:

   o  A DVB service

   o  Components within a DVB service (such as an audio or video stream)

   o  An event (for example, a programme)

   o  A transport stream

   o  A file contained within a DSM-CC object carousel

   o  Interactive applications

3.1.  Syntax

   DVB URLs conform to one of the two following formats:

      "dvb://" <original_network_id> "." [ <transport_stream_id> ] [ "."
      <service_id> [ "." <component-set> [ "$" <carousel-id> ] ] [
      <event-constraint> ] ] [ <path-absolute> ]

      "dvb://'" <textual_service_id> "'" [ "." <component-set> [ "$"
      <carousel-id> ] ] [ <event-constraint> ] [ <path-absolute> ]

   The URL format is defined in terms of the Augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) notation of [RFC 5234] below.  The ABNF below makes use of the
   following core ABNF syntax rules defined by that specification:
   DIGIT, ALPHA, and HEXDIGIT.  Additionally, the ABNF below makes use
   of host and path-absolute as defined by [RFC 3986].

   dvb_url             =  scheme ":" hier-part

   scheme              =  "dvb"

   hier-part           =  net-path / abs-path

   net-path            =  "//" ( entity [ abs-path ] ) / app-entity

   entity-path         =  entity abs-path

5.  Security Considerations

   Section 7 of [RFC 3986] describes general security considerations for
   URI schemes.  The sections relating to reliability and consistency,
   malicious construction, back-end transcoding, rare IP address formats
   and semantic attacks all apply to dvb URIs.  The section relating to
   sensitive information does not apply, given that dvb URIs do not
   contain authentication information.

   The security considerations of the Digital Video Broadcasting suite
   of standards in general are not covered in this document.
