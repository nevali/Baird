				Project Baird is a collection of specifications defining means

		<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
			<t>
				Project Baird is the name given to an effort intended to collate
				specifications in order to define an architecture by which broadcast
				television and radio programming can be augmented by Internet-based
				services.
			</t>
			<t>
				Where possible, Project Baird makes use of existing standards - the
				intent is not to invent an entire ecosystem, but to bring together
				specifications which already exist in order to create a coherent
				environment.
			</t>
			<t>
				Project Baird is deliberately agnostic in as many respects as possible:
				for example, any broadcasting system can be used provided services (stations)
				and events (programmes) can be uniquely identified in the form of
				fully-qualified domain names and URIs respectively.
			</t>
			<t>
				The below sections outline expected deployment scenarios in general
				terms, followed by an brief overview of each of the different aspects
				of the Baird environment.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Deployment scenarios" anchor="deploy">
			<t>
				Project Baird is not a single specification to a particular environment
				either conforms or does not in a simple binary fashion: there are a range
				of different configurations with varying levels of functionality all of
				which fall within the scope of the project.
			</t>
			<t>
				Project Baird is structured in this manner to allow for gradual adoption
				on the parts of both consumers and broadcasters: wholesale upgrades, while
				feasible to an extent on the part of broadcasters (cost permitting) is
				rarely a realistic proposition for consumers. For this reason, the
				first scenario described here involves no new reception hardware.
			</t>
			<t>
				As Project Baird's aims are, first and foremost, to provide an open-ended
				architecture -- frameworks upon which applications can be developed -- the
				services which can be made available will only grow over time. Moreover,
				by specifying how existing systems can be augmented in order to make this possible,
				rather than seeking to define every aspect of a hybrid TV/Internet environment,
				it does not restrict the applications which can be developed: there is no
				central authority which must grant approval to content providers,
				independent developers or hardware vendors before applications, products and
				devices can be distributed -- each party only has to conform to the specifications
				for the functionality they implement.
			</t>
			<section title="Traditional receiver with secondary devices">
				<t>
					In this scenario, a consumer has a traditional receiver, for example a
					television with an integrated receiver, or some kind of set-top device;
					the receiver is not connected to the consumer's local network or the
					Internet at all.
				</t>
				<t>
					However, the consumer does, have other devices which are Internet-connected:
					perhaps a laptop or a smartphone. An application or website can, once
					informed by the consumer as to which channel their receiver is tuned
					to, provide related content (including secondary audio/visual streams,
					timed events, or even a simulcast of the broadcast programme). Although the
					secondary device will not automatically be notified if the user switches
					channels, for example, there remains a broad set of functionality which
					can be made available.
				</t>
				<t>
					If there are multiple devices operating on the local network, then they will
					be able to communicate and co-ordinate with one another regarding the
					programmes being received: for example, "household recommendations" could
					be presented which are intended to be appropriate not just to the single
					user but to the entire household based upon the presence of multiple devices.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Hybrid receiver">
				<t>
					An alternate scenario is one where a receiver is itself Internet-connected
					but does not communicate with any secondary devices. Many modern cable TV
					set-top boxes fall in to this category today.
				</t>
				<t>
					As compared to the previous scenario, some aspects of the available
					functionality are enhanced, while others are handicapped. For example, the
					receiver holds the information regarding the current programme being
					received, and can communicate with Internet-based services directly in
					order to obtain secondary content, interactive applications, and some
					social features.
				</t>
				<t>
					A hybrid receiver can be capable of whole range of applications, allowing
					delivery of content from both Internet-based and broadcast sources. Service
					discovery allows for applications and content related specifically to
					services and programmes (whether they're delivered via linear broadcast or
					via the Internet) to be automatically located and presented.
				</t>
			</section>
			<section title="Hybrid receiver with secondary devices">
				<t>
					A consumer who has both a hybrid receiver and secondary devices is afforded the
					benefits of both of the preceding scenarios. This scenario offers a wealth of
					opportunities: rather than simply being disjoint collections of devices which
					happen to join the same network (and even then, only to access the Internet),
					devices can work together and coordinate in order to provide services to the
					consumer.
				</t>
				<t>
					When combined with secondary devices, a hybrid receiver can act as a
					conduit, as well as a local -- private -- server for protocols such as
					XMPP upon which a range of highly localised and targeted applications
					could be developed (for example, programme recommendations with the benefit of
					context in the form of presence information).
				</t>
				<t>
					Multiple devices working in tandem in this way leads to a vast range of
					possible applications from the comparatively basic -- such as remote
					control and inquiry over the network -- to the more complete, such as
					delivery of personalised, interactive, context-dependent content to
					secondary devices.
				</t>
				<t>
					Secondary devices which have the ability to communicate with the receiver
					also allow applications to be implemented which, although theoretically
					possible with a stand-alone hybrid receiver, would suffer from usability
					issues when put into practice.
