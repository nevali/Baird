Introduction</h3>

<p>Standards governing televisions, set-top boxes and other consumer electronics devices
            have for some time been developed with the Internet in mind. The use of Universal
            Resource Identifiers (URIs) <a class='info' href='#RFC3986'>[RFC3986]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Berners-Lee, T., Fielding, R., and L. Masinter, &ldquo;Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> is now commonplace, including for
            the purpose of identifying resources delivered by way of terrestrial, satellite and
            cable broadcasts.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, a URI scheme was developed as part of the <a class='info' href='#DVB'>Digital
               Video Broadcasting<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;DVB Project,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> [DVB] suite of standards specifically for the purpose of
            identifying broadcasts delivered by way of DVB-compliant broadcasting systems.
</p>
<p>With the advent of digital broadcasting, digital multimedia broadcast services to the
            home, based on MPEG-2 Transport Streams <a class='info' href='#MPEG-Systems'>[MPEG&#8209;Systems]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Society of Motion Picture and Television                      Engineers, &ldquo;Information technology -- Generic coding of moving pictures and associated                   audio information: Systems,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, have been widely
            available in recent years. Each broadcast programme and component (i.e. audio-visual and
            generic data components) are identifiable within the MPEG-2 Transport Stream. Beyond
            digital broadcast, television and radio programmes can be delivered to receivers over an
            IP-based network within MPEG-2 Transport Stream packets.
</p>
<p>The Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) service for television and radio programmes which
            allows people to find and select programmes must be able to identify a given programme
            in a canonical form. As programme guides are increasingly being made available on the
            Web, and on-device programme guides are taking advantage of Internet connectivity, and
            as receiving devices are increasingly able to present programmes delivered both via
            digital broadcast and a variety of IP-based protocols, the the use of URIs to identify
            programmes is an obvious pragmatic choice.
</p>
<p>This document defines the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcast
            programme resources over MPEG-2 Transport Stream <a class='info' href='#MPEG-Systems'>[MPEG&#8209;Systems]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Society of Motion Picture and Television                      Engineers, &ldquo;Information technology -- Generic coding of moving pictures and associated                   audio information: Systems,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> for DVB
            services, conforming to the generic URI syntax <a class='info' href='#RFC3986'>[RFC3986]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Berners-Lee, T., Fielding, R., and L. Masinter, &ldquo;Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> to aid in
            interoperability with existing IP-based services.
</p>
<p>The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led consortium of over 270
            broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators, software developers, regulatory bodies
            and others in over 35 countries committed to designing global standards for the global
            delivery of digital television and data services. Services using DVB standards are
            available on every continent with a total of more than 500 million DVB receivers already
            deployed. More information on DVB can be found on their website at <a href='http://www.dvb.org'>http://www.dvb.org</a>

Transmission Scheme</h3>

<p>The audio, visual or private data components constituting a TV/radio programme
               ("service") are defined as elementary stream (ES) components. Several of these
               TV/radio programmes are bundled in a transport stream (TS) multiplex for delivering
               over a broadcast transmission network (e.g. satellite, cable or terrestrial). The
               distinguished unique number for each TS multiplexed packet, elementary stream
               component, transport stream and transmission network is assigned and transmitted over
               the satellite, cable or terrestrial broadcasting media, or over an IP network,
               together with an information table which describesthese assigned numbers, as
               described by the MPEG-2 standard <a class='info' href='#MPEG-Systems'>[MPEG&#8209;Systems]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Society of Motion Picture and Television                      Engineers, &ldquo;Information technology -- Generic coding of moving pictures and associated                   audio information: Systems,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<p>These elements are unambiguously identified in DVB systems through numerical
               identifiers: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A <strong>network_id</strong> identifies a broadcast transmission
                     network. On satellite and IP broadband, typically one network_id corresponds to
                     an operator. On cable and terrestrial, where different radio frequencies might
                     be used in different regions, operators typically use one network_id per such
                     region.
</li>
<li>An <strong>original_network_id</strong> is used where TV/radio
                     programmes are taken from one network and are re-transmitted on another one
                     (noting that a "network" in this context may simply be a different broadcast
                     region for the same operator). The original_network_id is therefore used by
                     receivers as a means of determining equivalence across different networks.
</li>
<li>A <strong>transport_stream_id</strong> is used to refer to a
                     time-domain multiplex of several programmes carried in TS packets. One or more
                     multiplexes can be transmitted on any given radio frequency in a DVB
                     network.
</li>
<li>A <strong>service_id</strong> identifies a TV, radio or data
                     programme within a TS multiplex. The number of programmes is limited by the
                     capacity of the underlying physical channel. 
</li>
<li>A <strong>component_tag</strong> identifies an elementary stream
                     (ES) of video, audio, teletext, subtitles, or other data within a service.
</li>

<p>The original_network_id is an attribute of a transport stream (TS). In the simplest
               case, all services originate from the network on which they are transmitted. In this
               case, the original_network_id of all the TS will be equal to the network_id, and this
               typically occurs on networks operated by public broadcasters. If one of the public
               broadcaster's transport streams is, for example, re-transmitted by a cable operator,
               the information about this stream would containe the cable operator's network_id, and
               the original_network_id of the public broadcaster.
</p>
<p>Thus, all assigned network_id values must correlate with actual broadcast
               infrastructure, whereas this is not required for original_network_id values which
               have a more logical basis. A globally active content provider may for example choose
               to register an original_network_id, and distribute pre-multiplexed transport stream
               to broadcasters, without operating any broadcast network of its own.
</p>
<p>The assignment of values for both original_network_id and the network_id are
               coordinated by the DVB Project. The DVB Project in turn has delegated the management
               of DVB identifiers to DVB Services S&agrave;rl <a class='info' href='#DVB-SVCS'>[DVB&#8209;SVCS]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;DVB Services S&agrave;rl,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. DVB
               Services maintains a public register of all assignments, and accepts requests for new
               assignments on their website.
</p>
<p>Due to the way broadcast transmission networks are operated (and, to an extent, the
               design of MPEG-2), some relationships exist between these identifiers: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li> Each TS is part of exactly one orginial_network_id (see above). 
</li>
<li> Hence, each TS is unambiguously identified by the tuple {original_network_id,
                     transport_stream_id}. 
</li>
<li> According to <a class='info' href='#DVB-SI-SPEC'>[DVB&#8209;SI&#8209;SPEC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Specification for Service Information (SI)                   in DVB systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, each service_id is unique within a
                     TS. Hence a service is unambiguously identified by the tuple
                     {original_network_id, transport_stream_id, service_id}. 
</li>
<li>
                     <a class='info' href='#DVB-SI-GDL'>[DVB&#8209;SI&#8209;GDL]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Guidelines on implementation and usage of                   Service Information (SI),&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> additionally requires that each service_id be
                     unique within an original_network_id. Hence, in areas where <a class='info' href='#DVB-SI-GDL'>[DVB&#8209;SI&#8209;GDL]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Guidelines on implementation and usage of                   Service Information (SI),&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> has been made part of the broadcast profile, the tuple
                     {original_network_id, service_id} unambiguously identifies a service. 
</li>
</ul><p>
            
</p>
<p>During the process of performing a "service scan", a receiver will capture the
               identifying information contained within the transport streams and store their
               transport_stream_id, original_network_id and network_id, as well as the service_id
               values of all of the services carried within that transport stream. As each radio
               frequency channel is scanned, the receiver constructs a table correlating each of
               these tuples with the radio frequency channels and other modulation parameters, such
               that when it is required to switch to specific service within a transport stream, it
               can tune the radio receiver appropriately. Within the context of <a class='info' href='#DVB-IPTV'>[DVB&#8209;IPTV]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Transport of MPEG-2 TS Based DVB Services                   over IP Based Networks,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, of course, there are no radio frequencies, however the same
               model of broadcasters, networks and services is maintained and the same identifiers
               are used with the same semantics.
</p>
<p>A DVB service is composed of one or more components. These are identified within the
               context of a service by their component_tag. A component can be either an elementary
               stream (ES) carrying video, audio, teletext, subtitles, or other synchronised data or
               generic data (see also <a class='info' href='#DVB-DATA'>[DVB&#8209;DATA]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); DVB specification for data                   broadcasting,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#DVB-TVA'>[DVB&#8209;TVA]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Carriage and signalling of TV-Anytime                   information in DVB transport streams,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#DVB-MHP'>[DVB&#8209;MHP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) Specification                   1.1.1,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>).

                  systems, but may also be retrieved on-demand from a server via the Internet.
                  Providers of such broadcast services may e.g. reference programmes in the
                  broadcast from an Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) which is published on their
                  web- site. On another example, the metadata which is part of the multimedia
                  broadcasts can also contain such URIs to establish hyperlinks between broadcast
                  services. This might for instance include multi-angle video services (e.g. for
                  sports events). Users of suitably-equipped clients -- i.e. with a suitable tuner
                  card and software installed (Open Source tools including <a href='http://www.linuxtv.org/'>http://www.linuxtv.org/</a> and <a href='http://www.mythtv.org/'>http://www.mythtv.org/</a>)
                  -- are able to exchange such URIs (e.g. via an instant messaging service or email)
                  to provide each other clickable hyperlinks to multimedia content they deem of
                  interest.
</p>
<p>DVB has published specifications for the distribution of multimedia services via
                  IP unicast and multicast mechanisms. In this context, such URIs are usable in any
                  player client software (no tuner card required) that implements the respective
                  protocols and has the relevant audio and video codecs installed.

<a name="rfc.section.2.3.2"></a><h3>2.3.2.&nbsp;
Resolution Considerations</h3>

<p>The resolution process is determined through the development of DVB standards by
                  the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB).
</p>
<p>Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices with quite
                  different access methods and capabilities, no single resolution or delegation
                  mechanism can be referenced in this document.
</p>
<p>Currently 2 client system classes are covered by DVB specifications:
</p>
<p>
                  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A broadcast set-top box or other receiver which only has a unidirectional,
                        receive-only connection -- for example by way of a UHF radio receiver.
                        Hence, all DVB URIs need to be resolvable from the service discovery
                        information received within the broadcast stream.
</li>
<li>A "home network end device" (HNED) which could be an IPTV set-top box,
                        networked TV or personal digital recorder with an Ethernet or WLAN
                        connection to a home gateway device.
</li>
</ul><p>
               
</p>
<p>Further device classes will be addressed as DVB standardisation progresses. The
                  dvb URIs must however remain valid. DVB will define appropriate resolution
                  mechanisms to ensure that DVB URIs remain valid for those new device classes as
                  well.
</p>
<p>For the two above example device classes, three mechanisms of conveying such
                  resolution information are currently defined by DVB:
</p>
<p>
                  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Repeated, cyclic transmission of service discovery information as auxiliary
                        data in digital TV broadcast streams over satellite, cable or terrestrial
                        transmissions according to <a class='info' href='#DVB-SI-SPEC'>[DVB&#8209;SI&#8209;SPEC]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Specification for Service Information (SI)                   in DVB systems,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#DVB-DATA'>[DVB&#8209;DATA]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); DVB specification for data                   broadcasting,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#DVB-TVA'>[DVB&#8209;TVA]<span> (</span><span class='info'>DVB Project, &ldquo;Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Carriage and signalling of TV-Anytime                   information in DVB transport streams,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>. Typically, this
                        information is collated and stored during a "service scan". It can then be
                        looked up at point of resolution, and the receiver may tune to the
                        associated frequency and if demultiplex the appropriate transport

Identifier Management</h3>

<p>For some of the identifiers used in the DVB URI syntax, DVB provides a public

                     On that site, the registry tables can be viewed, downloaded, and applications
                     for new identifiers can be submitted. Most of the identifiers not listed in the
                     registry are under the scope of one of the registered identifiers (for example
                     the service_id is under control of the holder of a network_id or
                     original_network_id). A select few identifiers are not open for registration to

                  The user might e.g. have set a flag on the programme, so that the receiver will

                  service components can be selected for recording, all components of the service
                  should generally be recorded where appropriate. This would for instance enable to
                  use the original language audio instead of the dubbed version on special playback
                  occasions.

                        the given service, and for the indicated event within that service. The EPG
                        information will contain the wall-clock start time and duration of the
                        programme as published e.g. also in print. Since the actual times of
                        transmission may be different, triggers should only be fired with
                        appropriate lead-in and lead-out times relative to the published EPG times.
                        Receivers can also use additional information in the EPG, in particular the
                        running_status. Not all broadcasters do however manage the running_status

                        hours, 31 minutes and 17 seconds. This form of the URI can be used to convey
                        more accurate transmission times for the content. The programme may be
                        advertised as starting at 00:00 and ending at 00:30 in the EPG. This
                        extended information in the locator can be used to get a much more accurate
                        trigger for the programme. The lead-in and lead-out times can be reduced to
                        the minimum needed to account for the skews of the local and broadcaster
