         <t>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme resources
            transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/> have been
            devised in their process of creating standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project
            (DVB), the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the
            OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled
            publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications such as HTTP, MHP
            <xref target="DVB-MHP"/>, OCAP <xref target="OCAP1.0"/> or other XML based
            metadata.</t>

         <t>These URI locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other multimedia broadcast programme
            service (i.e. channel or event) and the audio-visual components conforming to that
            programme for e.g. a HTTP based programme guide in the internet or other XML based
            programme guides in digital broadcast set-top boxes. </t>

         <t>This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the Internet community,
            given its definition as part of the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) suite of ETSI
            standards.</t>

      <section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
         <t>Standards governing televisions, set-top boxes and other consumer electronics devices
            have for some time been developed with the Internet in mind. The use of Universal
            Resource Identifiers (URIs) <xref target="RFC3986"/> is now commonplace, including for
            the purpose of identifying resources delivered by way of terrestrial, satellite and
            cable broadcasts.</t>

         <t>For this purpose, a URI scheme was developed as part of the <xref target="DVB">Digital
               Video Broadcasting</xref> suite of standards specifically for the purpose of
            identifying broadcasts delivered by way of DVB-compliant broadcasting systems. </t>

         <t>With the advent of digital broadcasting, digital multimedia broadcast services to the
            home, based on MPEG-2 Transport Streams <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/> have been widely
            available in recent years. Each broadcasting programme and composing components (i.e.
            audio-visual and generic data components) are identifiable in the MPEG-2 Transport
            Stream. TV/Radio broadcasting programmes within MPEG-2 Transport Stream packets can be
            delivered over an IP network as well as over a digital broadcast network.</t>

         <t>The EPG (Electronic Programme Guide) service for TV/Radio programmes by which people are
            able to search-select and acquire the favorite programme, must be able to locate
            selected programme or service in a canonical form. This programme guide is now available
            on web servers through the internet or im metadata services within the digital
            broadcasting service to identify the actual broadcast programme material for such
            advanced broadcasting services.</t>

         <t>This document defines the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcast
            programme resources over MPEG-2 Transport Stream <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/> for DVB
            services, in conformance with the generic URI syntax <xref target="RFC3986"/> to have a
            high affinity with IP networks.</t>

         <t>The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led consortium of over 270
            broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators, software developers, regulatory bodies
            and others in over 35 countries committed to designing global standards for the global
            delivery of digital television and data services. Services using DVB standards are
            available on every continent with a total of more than 500 million DVB receivers already
            deployed. More information on DVB can be found on their website at <eref
               target="http://www.dvb.org">http://www.dvb.org</eref></t>

         <t>This URI specification is for a permanent assignment.</t>

         <section title="Transmission Scheme">
            <t>The audio, visual or private data components constituting a TV/radio programme
               ("service") are defined as elementary stream (ES) components. Several of these
               TV/radio programmes are bundled in a transport stream (TS) multiplex for delivering
               over a broadcast transmission network (e.g. satellite, cable or terrestrial). The
               distinguished unique number for each TS mux packet, elementary stream component,
               transport stream and transmission network is assigned and transmitted over the
               satellite, cable or terrestrial broadcasting media, even over the IP network,
               together with the information table which describes these assigned numbers in the
               form of MPEG-2 standard <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/>.</t>

            <t>All these elements are unambiguously identified in DVB systems by numerical ids:<list
                  style="symbols">
                  <t>A <spanx style="strong">network_id</spanx> identifies a broadcast transmission
                     network. On satellite and IP broadband, typically one network_id corresponds to
                     an operator. On cable and terrestrial, where different radio frequencies might
                     be used in different regions, operators typically use one network_id per such
                     region.</t>
                  <t>An <spanx style="strong">original_network_id</spanx> is used where TV/radio
                     programmes are taken from one network, and are re-transmitted on another one.
                     To enable receivers detecting that a programme is identical to another one, the
                     original_network_id is used to indicate from which network the programme
                     originates.</t>
                  <t>A <spanx style="strong">transport_stream_id</spanx> is used to refer to a
                     time-domain multiplex of several programmes carried in TS packets. One or more
                     multiplexes can be transmitted on any given radio frequency in a DVB
                     network.</t>
                  <t>A <spanx style="strong">service_id</spanx> identifies a TV/radio or data
                     programme within a TS multiplex. The number of programmes is limited by the
                     capacity of the underlying physical channel.</t>
                  <t>A <spanx style="strong">component_tag</spanx> identifies an elementary stream
                     (ES) of video, audio, teletext, subtitles, or other data within a service.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>The original_network_id is an attribute of a transport stream (TS). In the simplest
               case, all services originate from the network on which they are transmitted. Then,
               the original_network_id of all the TS will be equal to the network_id. This typically
               happens on networks operated by public broadcasters. If one of the public
               broadcaster's TS is for instance re-transmitted by a cable operator, the information
               about this TS would indicate the cable operator's network_id, and the
               original_network_id of the public broadcaster. Hence all assigned network_id values
               must represent actual broadcast network infrastructures, whereas this is not required
               for original_network_id values. A globally active content provider may for example
               choose to register an original_network_id, and distribute pre-multiplexed TS to
               broadcasters, without operating any broadcast network of its own.</t>
            
            <t>Both, the original_network_id and the network_id are coordinated by the DVB Project.
               The DVB Project in turn has delegated the management of DVB identifiers to DVB
               Services S&agrave;rl <xref target="DVB-SVCS"/>. DVB Services maintains a public
               register of all assignments, and accepts requests for new assignments on their
               website.</t>

            <t>Due to the way broadcast transmission networks are operated, some relationships exist
               between these identifiers:<list style="symbols">
                  <t>Each TS is part of exactly one orginial_network_id (see above).</t>
                  <t>Hence, each TS is unambiguously identified by the tuple {original_network_id,
                     transport_stream_id}.</t>
                  <t>According to <xref target="DVB-SI-SPEC"/>, each service_id is unique within a
                     TS. Hence a service is unambiguously identified by the tuple
                     {original_network_id, transport_stream_id, service_id}.</t>
                  <t><xref target="DVB-SI-GDL"/> additionally requires that each service_id be
                     unique within an original_network_id. Hence, in areas where
                     <xref target="DVB-SI-GDL"/> has been made part of the broadcast profile, the tuple
                     {original_network_id, service_id} unambiguously identifies a service.</t>
               </list></t>

            <t>During a scan run, a receiver will pick up information about TS. It will learn their
               transport_stream_id, original_network_id and network_id. Since it scans different
               radio frequency channels, it is able to link these identifiers to radio frequencies
               and other modulation parameters. On <xref target="DVB-IPTV"/>, of course no radio
               frquencies are used. The model of broadcasters, networks, and services is however
               maintained. Hence a <xref target="DVB-IPTV"/> receiver uses the same identifiers with
               the above semantics to identify services.</t>

            <t>Finally, a DVB service is composed of one or more components. These are identified
               within the service by their component_tag. A component can be either an elementary
               stream (ES) carrying video, audio, teletext, subtitles, or other synchronised data,
               or generic data (see also <xref target="DVB-DATA"/>, <xref target="DVB-TVA"/> and
                  <xref target="DVB-MHP"/>). Each of these components is then sliced into fragments
               and packetised in TS packets <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/>. All packets for a given
               component are labeled with the same TS packet identifier (PID), effectively providing
               a virtual channel in the TS for the component. All packtes are then multiplexed in
               the time domain according ot each component's data rate requirements, and the
               resulting TS is passed to the transmission equipment. For examples how these
               identifiers are used, please refer to <xref target="examples"/>.</t>

            <t>Section 5 of <xref target="DVB-URI"/> specifies that: </t>

            <t>&quot;All characters not within the range of characters allowed in a URI must be
               encoded into UTF-8 and included in the URI as a sequence of escaped octets. An
               escaped octet is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the percent character
               &quot;%&quot; followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing the octet

            <section title="Context of Use">
               <t>The "dvb" URIs are used as references to resources in digitial multimedia
                  programmes, most often within the context of DVB itself: interactive television
                  applications use them in order to locate resources and to reference services and
                  programmes. These are typically broadcast via satellite, cable and terrestrial
                  systems, but may also be retrieved on-demand from a server via the Internet.
                  Providers of such broadcast services may e.g. reference programmes in the
                  broadcast from an Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) which is published on their
                  web- site. On another example, the metadata which is part of the multimedia
                  broadcasts can also contain such URIs to establish hyperlinks between broadcast
                  services. This might for instance include multi-angle video services (e.g. for
                  sports events). Users of suitably equipepd clients - i.e. with a suitable tuner
                  card and software installed (Open Source tools include e.g.
                  http://www.linuxtv.org/ and http://www.mythtv.org/) - are able to exchange such
                  URIs (e.g. via an instant messaging service or email) to provide each other
                  clickable hyperlinks to multimedia content they deem of interest.</t>

               <t>DVB has published specifications for the distribution of multimedia services via
                  IP unicast and multicast mechanisms. In this context, such URIs are usable in any
                  player client software (no tuner card required) that implements the respective
                  protocols and has the relevant audio and video codecs installed. </t>
               <t><list style="symbols">
                     <t>For example, a receiver connected to a local area network might allow other
                        devices to query it for information regarding the current programme or
                        service: in this context, a dvb URI would typically be the most
                        authoritative single identifier which could be used to to refer to that
                        programme.</t>

                     <t>Similarly, a web service can be implemented by a platform operator or a
                        broadcaster (or some party working on their behalf) which allows resolution
                        of dvb URIs - this would allow a device to retrieve web pages or other
                        content which relate to the current programme (or some other entry in the
                        device's Electronic Programme Guide).</t>
                  </list></t>

               <t>Implementing such a system naturally requires some mechanism for devices to
                  discover an appropriate resolution service. DVB has developed has developed a
                  service discovery and selection (SD&amp;S) solution as part of

            <section title="Resolution Considerations">
               <t>The resolution is determined through the process of development of
                  DVB standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB).</t>
               
               <t>Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices with quite
                  different access methods and capabilities, no single resolution or delegation
                  mechanism can be referenced in this document.</t>
               
               <t>Currently 2 client system classes are covered by DVB specifications:</t>
               
               <t><list style="symbols">
                     <t>A broadcast set-top box which only has a unidirectional, receive-only
                        connection. Hence all DVB URIs need to be resolvable from the service
                        discovery information received in the broadcast stream.</t>
                  
                     <t>A "home network end device" (HNED) which could be an IPTV set-top box,
                        networked TV or personal digital recorder with an Ethernet or WLAN

               </t>
               
               <t>Further device classes will be addressed as DVB standardisation progresses. The
                  dvb URIs must however remain valid. DVB will define appropriate resolution
                  mechanisms to ensure that DVB URIs remain valid for those new device classes as
                  well.</t>
               
               <t>For the two above example device classes, 3 ways of conveying such resolution

                        accurate transmission times for the content. The programme may be advertised
                        as starting at 00:00 and ending at 00:30 in the EPG. This extended

                        trigger for the programme. The lead-in and lead-out times can be reduced to
                        the minimum needed to account for the skews of the local and broadcaster
