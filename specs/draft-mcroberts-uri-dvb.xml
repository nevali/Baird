         <t>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcasting programme resources
            transmitted over MPEG-2 Transport Streams <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/> have been
            devised in their process of creating standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project
            (DVB), the Association of Radio Industries and Businesses in Japan (ARIB) and the
            OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) to acquire current and future scheduled
            publications of broadcast media content from multimedia applications such as HTTP, MHP
            <xref target="DVB-MHP"/>, OCAP <xref target="OCAP1.0"/> or other XML based
            metadata.</t>

         <t>These URI locate the actual digital TV, Radio or other multimedia broadcast programme
            service (i.e. channel or event) and the audio-visual components conforming to that
            programme for e.g. a HTTP based programme guide in the internet or other XML based
            programme guides in digital broadcast set-top boxes. </t>

         <t>This document defines the "dvb" URI scheme for the benefit of the Internet community,

            standards.</t>

      <section title="Introduction">
         <t>Standards governing televisions, set-top boxes and other consumer electronics devices
            have for some time been developed with the Internet in mind. The use of Universal
            Resource Identifiers (URIs) <xref target="RFC3986"/> is now commonplace, including for
            the purpose of identifying resources delivered by way of terrestrial, satellite and
            cable broadcasts.</t>

         <t>For this purpose, a URI scheme was developed as part of the <xref target="DVB">Digital
               Video Broadcasting</xref> suite of standards specifically for the purpose of
            identifying broadcasts delivered by way of DVB-compliant broadcasting systems. </t>

         <t>With the advent of digital broadcasting, digital multimedia broadcast services to the
            home, based on MPEG-2 Transport Streams <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/> have been widely
            available in recent years. Each broadcasting programme and composing components (i.e.
            audio-visual and generic data components) are identifiable in the MPEG-2 Transport
            Stream. TV/Radio broadcasting programmes within MPEG-2 Transport Stream packets can be
            delivered over an IP network as well as over a digital broadcast network.</t>

         <t>The EPG (Electronic Programme Guide) service for TV/Radio programmes by which people are
            able to search-select and acquire the favorite programme, must be able to locate
            selected programme or service in a canonical form. This programme guide is now available
            on web servers through the internet or im metadata services within the digital
            broadcasting service to identify the actual broadcast programme material for such
            advanced broadcasting services.</t>

         <t>This document defines the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) schemes for broadcast
            programme resources over MPEG-2 Transport Stream <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/> for DVB
            services, in conformance with the generic URI syntax <xref target="RFC3986"/> to have a
            high affinity with IP networks.</t>

         <t>The Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB) is an industry-led consortium of over 270
            broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators, software developers, regulatory bodies
            and others in over 35 countries committed to designing global standards for the global
            delivery of digital television and data services. Services using DVB standards are
            available on every continent with a total of more than 500 million DVB receivers already
            deployed. More information on DVB can be found on their website at <eref
               target="http://www.dvb.org">http://www.dvb.org</eref></t>

         <t>This URI specification is for a permanent assignment.</t>

               over a single BROADCASTING NETWORK (e.g. Satellite, Cable or Terrestrial). The
               distinguished unique number for each packet, elementary component, transport stream
               and transmission network is assigned and transmitted over the satellite, cable or
               terrestrial broadcasting media, even over the IP network, together with the
               information table which describes these assigned numbers in the form of MPEG-2
               standard <xref target="MPEG-Systems"/>.</t>

         <section title="Community Considerations">
            <section title="Context of Use">
               <t>The "dvb" URIs are used as references to resources in digitial multimedia
                  programmes, most often within the context of DVB itself: interactive television
                  applications use them in order to locate resources and to reference services and
                  programmes. These are typically broadcast via satellite, cable and terrestrial
                  systems, but may also be retrieved on-demand from a server via the Internet.
                  Providers of such broadcast services may e.g. reference programmes in the
                  broadcast from an Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) which is published on their
                  web- site. On another example, the metadata which is part of the multimedia
                  broadcasts can also contain such URIs to establish hyperlinks between broadcast
                  services. This might for instance include multi-angle video services (e.g. for
                  sports events). Users of suitably equipepd clients - i.e. with a suitable tuner
                  card and software installed (Open Source tools include e.g.
                  http://www.linuxtv.org/ and http://www.mythtv.org/) - are able to exchange such
                  URIs (e.g. via an instant messaging service or email) to provide each other
                  clickable hyperlinks to multimedia content they deem of interest.</t>

               <t>DVB has published specifications for the distribution of multimedia services via
                  IP unicast and multicast mechanisms. In this context, such URIs are usable in any
                  player client software (no tuner card required) that implements the respective
                  protocols and has the relevant audio and video codecs installed. </t>
               <t><list style="symbols">
                     <t>For example, a receiver connected to a local area network might allow other
                        devices to query it for information regarding the current programme or
                        service: in this context, a dvb URI would typically be the most
                        authoritative single identifier which could be used to to refer to that
                        programme.</t>

                     <t>Similarly, a web service could be implemented by a platform operator or a
                        broadcaster (or some party working on their behalf) which allows resolution
                        of dvb URIs - this would allow a device to retrieve web pages or other
                        content which relate to the current programme (or some other entry in the
                        device's Electronic Programme Guide).</t>
                  </list></t>

               <t>Implementing such a system naturally requires some mechanism for devices to
                  discover an appropriate resolution service. DVB has developed has developed a
                  service discovery and selection (SD&amp;S) solution as part of
                  <xref target="DVB-IPTV"/>.

            <section title="Resolution Considerations">
               <t>The resolution is determined through the process of development of
                  DVB standards by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB).</t>
               
               <t>Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices with quite
                  different access methods and capabilities, no single resolution or delegation
                  mechanism can be referenced in this document.</t>
               
               <t>Currently 2 client system classes are covered by DVB specifications:</t>
               
               <t><list style="symbols">
                     <t>A broadcast set-top box which only has a unidirectional, receive-only
                        connection. Hence all DVB URIs need to be resolvable from the service
                        discovery information received in the broadcast stream.</t>
                  
                     <t>A "home network end device" (HNED) which could be an IPTV set-top box,
                        networked TV or personal digital recorder with an Ethernet or WLAN
                        connection to a home gateway device.</t>
               </list>
               </t>
               
               <t>Further device classes will be addressed as DVB standardisation progresses. The
                  dvb URIs must however remain valid. DVB will define appropriate resolution
                  mechanisms to ensure that DVB URIs remain valid for those new device classes as
                  well.</t>
               
               <t>For the two above example device classes, 3 ways of conveying such resolution
                  information are currently defined by DVB:</t>

                  <t>To obtain the initial Service Discovery and Selection (SD&amp;S) XML record, a
                     client must by default first join the IANA registered well-known multicast

                     (DvbServDisc on IPv6) and try to obtain a boot-strap record from the IANA
                     registered well-known port dvbservdsc (port number 3937) via tcp and udp (see
                     <eref target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers">

                  <t>To discover non-default entry points addresses, <xref target="DVB-IPTV"/>
                     defines that a list of Service Discovery and Selection (SD&amp;S) entry points
                     addresses may be acquired via DNS according to the service location resource
                     record (SRV RR) <xref target="RFC2782"/>. The service name is "_dvbservdsc",
                     the protocol may be tcp or udp, while the rest of the name is the domain name
                     maintained by DVB for service discovery. This domain name is set to
                     "services.dvb.org". So the lookup shall be either
                     "_dvbservdsc._tcp.services.dvb.org" or "_dvbservdsc._udp.services.dvb.org".
                     This requires that the terminal support an SRV cognizant DNS client and
                     according to the specification in <xref target="RFC2782"/>. The DVB
                     organization will maintain the services.dvb.org domain name for service
                     discovery. HTTP servers will be found via the tcp protocol method whilst the
                     multicast addresses will be found via the udp protocol method.</t>
