<em>Service discovery</em> is the process by which IP-based applications, 
including audiovisual content feeds, can be located by connected and
companion devices.

There are three main “strands” to this:

1. [TVDNS](tvdns/) - allowing automatic discovery of broadcasters' IP-delivered services relating over-the-air broadcasts
2. Advertising and locating IP-delivered services on a local network with [Bonjour](bonjour/)
3. [Subscribing](subscriptions/) to services manually (i.e., user-initiated subscriptions)

Layered above the discovery layer are the IP-delivered [services](/services/) themselves.
