Project Baird specifies a variety of different applications which are accessed
using IP-based connectivity. Some of these applications are designed
exclusively for use between devices on a local network, others are intended
to be delivered by a broadcaster’s servers and may be related to specific
programming, while some can be used independently of any over-the-air
broadcasts. Each application’s specification will indicate which discovery
and delivery mechanisms are applicable.

* [Metadata resolution](broadcast-meta/): Retrieval of programme metadata for over-the-air broadcasts
* [Feed manifests](feed-manifests/): Describing sets of feeds (and their relationship to over-the-air services)
* [Content feeds](feeds/): Describing both linear and on-demand content, and relationships between IP-delivered and over-the-air content
* [Pairing protocol](pairing-protocol/): Generic mechanism for pairing devices across a local network
* [Remote control](remote-control/): Allowing secondary devices on a local network to inspect and control a receiver or DVR
