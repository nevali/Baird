## Project Baird

Project Baird is a [collaborative effort](http://github.com/nexgenta/Baird/)
to create a set of open-ended, device-agnostic, platform-neutral,
cross-broadcaster specifications for delivering different kinds of content
to digital TV devices across the Internet.

Project Baird is built upon, wherever possible, existing standards and
projects. Anybody is welcome to fork and submit patches to the Project
Baird repository.

### Focus areas

1. Service discovery: how devices can automatically locate services relating to over-the-air broadcasts, and how users can easily subscribe to new (IP-only) services.
2. Service manifests: a mechanism for a collection of related Atom feeds to be bundled together
3. Web application support for TV tuners
4. Device profiles: tailoring content to different classes of device (e.g., mobile, handheld, full HD)
5. Content feeds: describing both linear and on-demand primary and secondary content to devices
6. Metadata services: providing rich metadata about broadcast programming to devices
7. Recommendations and sharing across the social graph
8. Dynamic EPG allocation: integrating linear IP-delivered content and over-the-air broadcasts into a single programme guide
9. Device advertisements and remote control over the local network

### Key standards and related projects

built.

and the above; they are simply those projects which are particularly important
to this effort).
